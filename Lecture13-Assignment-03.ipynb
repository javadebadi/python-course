    "You are a Python developer writing a visualization package. For any element in a visualization, you want to be able to tell the position of the element, how far it is from other elements, and easily implement horizontal or vertical flip .\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic element of any visualization is a single point. In this exercise, you'll write a class for a point on a plane from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the `class` `Point` that has:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two attributes, `x` and `y` - the coordinates of the point on the plane\n",
    "- A constructor that accepts two arguments, `x` and `y`, that initialize the corresponding attributes. These arguments should have default value of `0.0`;\n",
    "- A method `distance_to_origin()` that returns the distance from the point to the origin. The formula for that is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\rm{distance~to~origin} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "- Overload the `abs` operator for the class. The `abs` function must return the same value as `distance_to_origin` method. Look at [here](https://realpython.com/operator-function-overloading/) to know what to overload `abs` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A method `reflect()`, that reflects the point with respect to the x- or y-axis:\n",
    "    - accepts one argument `axis`, if `axis` equals to `\"x\"` , it sets the `y` attribute to the negative value of the `y` attribute, if `axis` equals to `\"y\"`, it sets the `x` attribute to the negative value of the `x` attribute, for any other value of `axis`, raise `ValueError` with appropriate message `\"The given values for axis is not supported\"`.      \n",
    "- Overlaod `+` operator to do the following for the points:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(x_1, y_1) + (x_2, y_2) = (x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2)\n",
    "$$ The `+` must take two `Point` objects and return a `Point` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overload string representation of the point so that it if `pt = Point(3,4)` then `str(pt)` results in `'(x, y) = (3, 4)'`. Note that the spaces are important in this string.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note: You can choose to use `sqrt()` function from the math package.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check your work, you should be able to run the following code without errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    ">>> pt = Point(x=3.0)\n",
    ">>> pt.reflect(\"y\")\n",
    ">>> print((pt.x, pt.y))\n",
    "(-3.0,0.0)\n",
    ">>> pt.y = 4.0\n",
    ">>> print(pt.distance_to_origin())\n",
    "5.0\n",
